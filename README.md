## The Toolchain

### Void Linux
After taking a look under the `systemd` hood, I searched out a modern
Linux without an arrogant `init` system. [Void Linux](http://voidlinux.eu)
is a rock solid little number with a very high build quality and a rapidly
maturing userland. It also has a very light touch, which is much appreciated
after seeing `systemd` eat the guts out of Arch Linux.

### HerbstluftWM
[Herbstluftwm](https://herbstluftwm.org/) is a fantastic tiling
WM. Configuration is heavily skewed toward integration with a shell
environment.

### ZSH
No justification required.

### Kakoune
After many years of using Vim (and later Neovim), I have switched to
[Kakoune](http://kakoune.org/). Similar in spirit, but with fundamental and
compelling differences and no baggage.
